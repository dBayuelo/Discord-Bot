# Discord-Bot
Personal bot project for the Discord messaging app. Built with Python 3.7 and using mariaDB 
More features may be added in the future as I have the free time to do so.

Primary bot file "bot.py" is run to begin the bot. Auxiliary files (called cogs) exist in a directory called cogs in order to facilitate testing new features without the need to restart the bot.
